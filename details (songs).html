It's easy to meet someone who could share some of your traits or personality, but they could never be you. You're someone not easy to forget, trust me. Unexpectedly, on a random day, you became my first friend inside our 10th grade classroom. The bond we shared the following years is something I could and would not forget, and it's something worth being grateful for. And I am, incredibly grateful. Our friendship has been a cornerstone of my high school experience, and the memories we made together are invaluable. I'm incredibly grateful for the time we've spent and for the person you are. You're a person not easy to forget, and the memories we shared are precious and hard to let go of. Thank you for everything you've done.",

Even though this struggle may be invisible to others, and you feel as if you're always going to be stuck, things will fall into place in time. As a wise person once said, 'things happen for a reason.' What's meant for you will find its way to you, and you'll find your path through those tough times. It's okay to prioritize yourself and make choices that are best for you. Seeking something better and finding peace of mind is important, altogether.

This song kinds of reflect that struggle; turning around and having visions of something that just feels out of reach. While listening, I'm reminded of how I might come off as a distant person. My attemps to reach out and make up for that detachment are genuine, even if it may not always come across as intended. Despite all the times my words and actions had fell short, I do want to express that I care. There are times where I'm caught up in my own bubble, and it feels like the friend I want to be for you is far away. I might not not always express it in the best way, but know that I'm here and trying to bridge that gap. My efforts to make up for that distance are sincere and I am continually working on that bridge and be the friend you deserve.",

It acknowledges the weight of personal struggles and the sense of being caught in your own battles, which aligns with the challenges of trying to connect deeply while feeling like you're falling short. The repeated reassurance in the song, 'Keep your head up,'' serves as a reminder that despite the hardships, there's always a path forward. Just as the song suggests, even when it feels like your efforts to connect might not be fully realized, I know that your attempts are deeply valued. Your daily efforts don't go unnoticed, and for those alone, you should be proud. 'epiphany' highlights that these feelings are part of the human experience, and it's okay to acknowledge them. Each step you take, no matter how small, is a significant part of your journey. The song's message of enduring through hard times and finding comfort in the struggle mirrors the baby steps you're taking towards bridging the gap and connecting more deeply. Even the smallest efforts are meaningful and contribute to the larger picture of growth and understanding. Your dedication each day are truly worth it, and just as the song offers comfort amidst hardships, your ongoing efforts to make meaningful changes are seen and valued.",

That's why, despite my natural tendencies, I am working on becoming the friend you deserve. You have an ability to make people feel better just by being you. You're attentive and thoughtful in a way no one can comprehend or compare to. Being your friend is a privilege, and I feel bad for people who won't be able to experience nor understand what I'm talking about. Even though I am unable to and dislike the idea of ever expressing myself, with you, it feels okay to do so. Thank you for being there, for making me feel that it's okay to be me.",
